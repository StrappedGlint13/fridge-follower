#Missing features and next steps

## Missing features

- Original idea was make "dishes" as hole selections of products, but during the project it did not seemed so good idea. 

- All datatables do not have full CRUD-functionalities.

## Next steps

- "Shared fridge" - there could be a possibility to combine and share fridges among users. Then there could be different kind of rights to manage "shared" fridges like _read only_ or _give full rights_

- Amounts of the products: There could be a selection box of fixed amounts, that would make "eating" or "wasting" food easier.

- In the future for accessible sake, there could be a RFID-reader, that could be use to implement ones products to the fridge easily.
