# Missing features and next steps

## Missing features

- Original idea was make "dishes" as hole selections of products, but during the project it did not seemed so good idea. 

- All datatables do not have full CRUD-functionalities. Only two datatables have full CRUD-functionality at the moment. 

- There could be more synchronization among the users via favorites-connection table. 

- Admin-role for instance to manage users. 

## Next steps

- "Shared fridge" - there could be a possibility to combine and share fridges among users. Then there could be different kind of rights to manage "shared" fridges like _read only_ or _give full_ -rights.

- Make full CRUD-functionality for all the datatables. 

- Make SQL-queries to the statistics of wasted money. Maybe some possible budgeting features for dishes and setting targets for avoiding waste food. 

- Amounts of the products: There could be a selection box of fixed amounts, that would make "eating" or "wasting" food easier.

- In the future for accessible sake, there could be a RFID-reader, that could be use to implement ones products to the fridge easily.
